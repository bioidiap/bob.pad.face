# Main body :

class VideoCascadeSvmPadAlgorithm(Algorithm):
    """
    This class is designed to train the **cascede** of SVMs given Frame Containers
    with features of real and attack classes. The procedure is the following:

    1. First, the input data is mean-std normalized.

    2. Second, the PCA is trained on normalized input features. Only the
       features of the **real** class are used in PCA training, both
       for one-class and two-class SVMs.

    3. The features are next projected given trained PCA machine.

    4. Prior to SVM training the features are again mean-std normalized.

    5. Next SVM machine is trained for each N projected features. First, preojected
       features corresponding to highest eigenvalues are selected. N is usually small
       N = (2, 3). So, if N = 2, the first SVM is trained for projected features 1 and 2,
       second SVM is trained for projected features 3 and 4, and so on.

    6. These SVMs then form a cascade of classifiers. The input feature vector is then
       projected using PCA machine and passed through all classifiers in the cascade.
       The decision is then made by majority voting.

    Both one-class SVM and two-class SVM cascades can be trained.
    In this implementation the grid search of SVM parameters is not supported.

    **Parameters:**

    ``machine_type`` : :py:class:`str`
        A type of the SVM machine. Please check ``bob.learn.libsvm`` for
        more details. Default: 'C_SVC'.

    ``kernel_type`` : :py:class:`str`
        A type of kerenel for the SVM machine. Please check ``bob.learn.libsvm``
        for more details. Default: 'RBF'.

    ``svm_kwargs`` : :py:class:`dict`
        Dictionary containing the hyper-parameters of the SVM.
        Default: {'cost': 1, 'gamma': 0}.

    ``N`` : :py:class:`int`
        The number of features to be used for training a single SVM machine
        in the cascade. Default: 2.

    ``pos_scores_slope`` : :py:class:`float`
        The positive scores returned by SVM cascade will be multiplied by this
        constant prior to majority voting. Default: 0.01 .

    ``frame_level_scores_flag`` : :py:class:`bool`
        Return scores for each frame individually if True. Otherwise, return a
        single score per video. Default: False.
