Files contain annotations for the color images in the **training** and **development** sets of the Idiap BATL database.

A region correponding to non-skin pixels is annotated in the "Attack" samples, and
region corresponding to skin pixels is annotated in the "Bona-fide" samples.

Annotations define a top-left and bottom-right corners of the ROI.

Note, annotations are made in images, which are first preprocessed. In this case
preprocessing is face detection, cropping and alignment.

The following pre-preprocessor was used before annotating:


FACE_SIZE = 128  # The size of the resulting face
RGB_OUTPUT_FLAG = True  # RGB output
USE_FACE_ALIGNMENT = True  # use annotations, which are coming from the database
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = None  # no limiting here
FACE_DETECTION_METHOD = None  # use annotations
MIN_FACE_SIZE = 50  # skip small faces

_image_preprocessor = FaceCropAlign(face_size = FACE_SIZE,
                                    rgb_output_flag = RGB_OUTPUT_FLAG,
                                    use_face_alignment = USE_FACE_ALIGNMENT,
                                    max_image_size = MAX_IMAGE_SIZE,
                                    face_detection_method = FACE_DETECTION_METHOD,
                                    min_face_size = MIN_FACE_SIZE)

_frame_selector = FrameSelector(selection_style = "all")

_preprocessor_rgb = Wrapper(preprocessor = _image_preprocessor,
                            frame_selector = _frame_selector)


The following setting were used for the database instance:

database = BatlPadDatabase(
    protocol='grandtest-color*infrared*depth-1', # just one frame is selected for annotation
    original_directory="/idiap/project/batl/datasets/database-batl-idiap/", 
    original_extension=".h5",
    annotations_temp_dir="", # don't use precomputed annotations
    landmark_detect_method="mtcnn", # mtcnn is used for landmark detection, above preprocessor is using these landmarks (FACE_DETECTION_METHOD = None)
    exclude_attacks_list=['makeup'], # makeup is excluded from annotations
    exclude_pai_all_sets=True) 

Note: eye-regions and medical glasses are also considered as BF patches in bona-fide faces.
